Growing up, I have always been entertained and amazed by video games. I remember playing numerous types of games on a Nintendo DS. I practically brought it around with me everywhere. As I grew up, my interest in video games have expanded from hand held systems, to gaming consoles, and now online gaming. I may not have realized it when I was young, but my interests in gaming have also gave me a basic understanding of technology. 

In today's society, technology has advanced drastically from before, and is still continuing to advance everyday. With its continuous advancement, it is hard for some to keep up with its constant updates. My friends and family for example, have always relied on me to help them with any computer issues or any electronic device issues. Because of that, working with with technology and assisting others when it comes to installing or trouble-shooting has become one of my strongest skills. Thus, sparking my interest in Management Information Systems. 

Currently, I am taking my first ITM class along with some Business Core classes. I hope to learn more about working with technology, especially with business oriented systems. Besides technology, the Business workforce is also seeing some major advancements that I would like to take a part in.
