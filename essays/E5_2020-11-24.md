When I first started BrowserHistory1, I went over the instructions thoroughly. I went over in my head what I needed to do. I started screen recording and worked on the WOD. About midway through the assignment, I was already over 25 minutes. As upset I was, I continued to do the assignment but without keeping track of time or screen recording. I made sure to take my time, so I could really understand what I needed to do. After about 37 minutes, I finished. I did a self reflection on what I needed to improve in order to get the WOD done faster. During my second time, I noticed I was going through the assignment much quicker. Unfortunately, my time came out to a little over 26 minutes. At this point I was frustrated but really determined to get at least the SD time. I ran through the finished product, noting down every possible shortcut I can make to reduce time. This includes simple copy and pasting, to memorizing the positions of the different types of tags. When I was confident enough, I set up the timer and started the screen recording. This time around, I finished and got it done in 22 minutes. Which lands in the SD range. This was a relief. Although, I did not plan on stopping there, I decided to take a break from BrowserHistory1 and work on BrowserHistory2 and BrowserHistory3.

My advice is to do the entire WOD without timing or recording yourself. Once you have completed the WOD.  Memorize it. This includes remembering what the next steps are and where each tag appears. Once you can fully remember what the document looks like, search and find out possible shortcuts you can take to reduce time as much as possible. Shortcuts like copying and pasting really came into my favor when doing this. I practically remembered when to Command C, Command X, and Command V based off of muscle memory. Once you feel that you are ready, start the screen recording and timer. Don’t be afraid to get a DNF and that you’ll have to redo it over and over. Enough practice will get you doing the entire assignment without even looking at the instructions anymore. Eventually, you’ll know exactly what to do and when to do it.
