1. Provide a brief introduction to the assignment along with a link to this page for further details.
Assignment 3 is essentially using all the tools we learned in class and putting them together in one project. It is basically an e-commerce store with more realistic functionalities in comparison to Assignment 2.

2. What did you learn from this assignment?
This assignment has taught me the use of cookies and sessions as well as the functionality of query strings. I feel that I learned a lot more about passing information from the client to the server and vise versa. As well as being able to use these tools as add ons rather than restarting as new project.

3. Did you work with a partner? Assign an estimated percentage on the amount each team member contributed to the assignment (including yourself).
I did not work with a partner.

4. How did you get help when you needed it? What did you need help with?
I received help from rewatching recorded lectures as well as referring to previous WODs and Labs. I usually ran into some errors which I was able to pass through with the help of W3Schools and StackExchange. I did email the professor as well when the errors were very specific.


5. How was developing this assignment different than assignment #1?
Assignment 1 was very different then Assignment 3. Developing Assignment 3 definitely required much more time and critical thinking in comparison to Assignment 1. I feel that Assignment 3 required a lot more things to make the project more user interactive.


6. Estimate the % of time you spent (a) thinking about how to do something, (b) writing code (but do not include testing, (c) testing and debugging
	a. 20% of my time went into planning the structure of the website.
	b. 20% of my time went into actually writing code.
	c. 60% of my time went into testing and debugging.

7. Describe what worked well with this project?
What worked well in this assignment was being able to incorporate sessions and cookies into my assignment 2. I was worried that I would have to start my Assignment 3 from scratch.

8. If you could go back in time and do things differently, what would you change?
 I feel that the assignment still has plenty of room for improvement. More so, in the designing and functionality of a real e-commerce website.
